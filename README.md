9th feb:<br />
members:Aseem Anand,I.Kalyan Anudeep<br />
decisions: We decided the key dates of meeting according to our academic schedule and created this repository<br />
13th feb(After the Lab session):<br />
members:Aseem Anand,I. Kalyan Anudeep<br />
discussion:We analysed the sim.py file sources demonstrated in the session and some internet sources.afterwards, we discussed about our ideas about how are we going proceed further<br />
decision:We decided to go throgh the core idea of project and have a meeting afterwards<br />
16th feb:<br />
members:Aseem Anand,I.Kalyan Anudeep<br />
decisions:As the deadline for phase 1 was just 1 week after, so we decided to implementnt our ideas through code ,I.Kalyan Anudeep agreed on implementing the add instruction just to give kickstart <br />
           to this exciting project<br />
Result:I.Kalyan Anudeep wrote a short pseudo code on implementing add instruction<br />
17th feb :<br />
members:Aseem Anand,I.Kalyan Anudeep<br />
discussion:We analysed the pseudo code for further instructions after writing some code <br />
decision: the first commit was made<br />
18th feb:<br />
members:Aseem Anand,I.Kalyan Anudeep<br />
decision:From the pseudo code we decided to implement further instructions and planned a meeting and debugging session on next date<br />
21st feb:<br />
members:Aseem Anand,I.Kalyan Anudeep<br />
debugging session:We merged the available code and had a short session of debugging the errors and exception in each other's code and commited the available code.<br />
discussion: Aseem Anand noticed that to proceed further we have to check for labels and pointed some arguments to implement & implemented that that whereas I.kalyan anudeep came up with some ideas on running 2 cores in processor <br />
22nd feb:<br />
discussion:Nothing much just a little debugging session<br />
24th feb:<br />
coding session:Aseem Anand did final touch in class core by adding some last instructions <br />
                I.kalyan Anudeep wrote the assembly code for bubble sort and selection sort & implemented running 2 cores in processor and some memory handling <br />
                with some final debugging session we completed the phase 1 of project
