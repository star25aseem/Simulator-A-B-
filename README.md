members:Aseem Anand,I.Kalyan Anudeep
decisions: We decided the key dates of meeting according to our academic schedule and created this repository
13th feb(After the Lab session):
members:Aseem Anand,I. Kalyan Anudeep
discussion:We analysed the sim.py file sources demonstrated in the session and some internet sources.afterwards, we discussed about our ideas about how are we going proceed further
decision:We decided to go throgh the core idea of project and have a meeting afterwards
16th feb:
members:Aseem Anand,I.Kalyan Anudeep
decisions:As the deadline for phase 1 was just 1 week after, so we decided to implementnt our ideas through code ,I.Kalyan Anudeep agreed on implementing the add instruction just to give kickstart 
           to this exciting project
Result:I.Kalyan Anudeep wrote a short pseudo code on implementing add instruction
17th feb :
members:Aseem Anand,I.Kalyan Anudeep
discussion:We analysed the pseudo code for further instructions after writing some code 
decision: the first commit was made
18th feb:
members:Aseem Anand,I.Kalyan Anudeep
decision:From the pseudo code we decided to implement further instructions and planned a meeting and debugging session on next date
21st feb:
members:Aseem Anand,I.Kalyan Anudeep
debugging session:We merged the available code and had a short session of debugging the errors and exception in each other's code and commited the available code.
discussion: Aseem Anand noticed that to proceed further we have to check for labels and pointed some arguments to implement & implemented that that whereas I.kalyan anudeep came up with some ideas on running 2 cores in processor 
22nd feb:
discussion:Nothing much just a little debugging session
24th feb:
coding session:Aseem Anand did final touch in class core by adding some last instructions 
                I.kalyan Anudeep wrote the assembly code for bubble sort and selection sort & implemented running 2 cores in processor and some memory handling 
                with some final debugging session we completed the phase 1 of project
